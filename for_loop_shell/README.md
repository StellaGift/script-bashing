Contains scripts for varying scenarios of the for loop condition.

file for0.sh - echos and iterates number range 0 - 100 over an object or variable.

file for1.sh - echos and iterates number range 0 - 100 with an increment of 2 over an object or variable, and sleeps for 0.2 with each iteration.

file for2.sh - echos and iterates number range in reverse order of 100 - 0 with an decrement of 2 over an object or variable, and sleeps for 0.3 with each iteration.

file for3.sh - echos and iterates number range in reverse order of 100 - 0 over an object or variable, and sleeps for 0.3 with each iteration.

file for4.sh - echos and increments a variable within the parameter of a set condition, and sleeps for 0.3 upon each iteration.

file for5.sh - echos value of a set variable in a decrement parameter, and sleeps for 0.3 upon each iteration.

file for6.sh - This is a for loop with an initialization in increment of 2 script, and performs sleep of 0.3 upon each iteration.

ile for7.sh - This is a for loop with an initialization in decrement of 2 script, and performs sleep of 0.3 upon each iteration.

file for8.sh- Uses the random variable to generate passwords, and ends each generated numbers with an extension of value parameter of 0 - 50. sleeps for 0.1 upon each generation.

file for9.sh Uses the random variable, together with an assigned variable to generate passwords containing an assigned char combined with the global variable int, and ends each generated numbers with an extension of value parameter of 0 - 50. sleeps for 0.2 upon each generation.
